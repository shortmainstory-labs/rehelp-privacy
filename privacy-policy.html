            <h1>ReHelp Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated"><strong>Last Updated:</strong> January 30, 2026</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>ReHelp ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your information when you use the ReHelp mobile application (the "App").</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Our Core Principle:</strong> ReHelp is built on trust, not surveillance. We collect only the minimum information necessary for the App to function and never sell or rent your personal data.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>ReHelp collects minimal information necessary for emergency alert functionality:</p>
        
        <h3>2.1 Information You Provide:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ReHelp ID:</strong> A unique identifier you create during onboarding (e.g., "ABCD-1234"). This is your only identifier in our system - no phone number, email, or real name required.</li>
            <li><strong>Display Name (Optional):</strong> A nickname you may choose for personalization.</li>
            <li><strong>Trusted Circle Connections:</strong> The ReHelp IDs of people you connect with for emergency alerts.</li>
            <li><strong>Medical Card Information (Optional):</strong> Medical information you choose to store (blood type, allergies, medications, emergency contacts). This is stored <strong>locally on your device only</strong> and never transmitted to our servers unless you share it during an emergency.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Your precise location is collected <strong>only when you activate an SOS alert</strong> and only if you grant location permission. Location is never tracked or stored when you are not sending an emergency alert.</li>
            <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Basic app functionality data (e.g., when you last checked in) to enable check-in reminders.</li>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Basic device information (operating system version) for compatibility and troubleshooting.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect solely to provide ReHelp's core safety features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Emergency Alerts:</strong> To send SOS alerts to your trusted circle when you activate the emergency button.</li>
            <li><strong>Location Sharing:</strong> To include your location in emergency alerts so your trusted contacts can find you.</li>
            <li><strong>Safe Check-Ins:</strong> To send "I'm safe" notifications to your trusted circle.</li>
            <li><strong>Trusted Circle Management:</strong> To maintain connections between you and your designated emergency contacts.</li>
            <li><strong>App Functionality:</strong> To provide core features like check-in reminders and alert history.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        
        <h3>4.1 Minimal Relay Backend:</h3>
        <p>ReHelp uses a minimal relay backend designed for privacy:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Permanent Storage:</strong> Emergency alerts are stored temporarily only to ensure delivery to your trusted circle.</li>
            <li><strong>Automatic Deletion:</strong> Alert data automatically expires and is deleted after 72 hours.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Storage:</strong> Your medical card and personal preferences are stored only on your device.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>4.2 Data Security:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>All data transmitted between your device and our servers is encrypted using industry-standard HTTPS/TLS protocols.</li>
            <li>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your data against unauthorized access, alteration, or destruction.</li>
            <li>Future updates will include end-to-end encryption for alert content.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>5. Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        <p><strong>We do NOT sell, rent, or trade your personal information with third parties.</strong></p>
        
        <h3>5.1 Information Shared with Your Trusted Circle:</h3>
        <p>When you send an emergency alert, the following information is shared with your designated trusted contacts:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Your ReHelp ID</li>
            <li>Alert type (SOS, Auto-SOS, or "I'm Safe")</li>
            <li>Your location (only if you activated an SOS alert and granted location permission)</li>
            <li>Timestamp of the alert</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>5.2 Legal Requirements:</h3>
        <p>We may disclose information if required by law, court order, or governmental authority, or if necessary to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
            <li>Protect the rights, property, or safety of ReHelp, our users, or the public</li>
            <li>Prevent fraud or security issues</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>6. Location Services</h2>
        <p><strong>Location Permission:</strong> ReHelp requests location access only when you activate an SOS alert. You can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Grant location permission when prompted during an emergency</li>
            <li>Deny location permission - your SOS alert will still be sent, but without location information</li>
            <li>Revoke location permission at any time in your device settings</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>We never track your location in the background or store location history.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>ReHelp is not intended for children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us immediately, and we will delete such information.</p>
